Researchers at Princeton has created what they call the first Photonic Nueral Network that uses varying wavelengths of light to run the network.

## Hackathon - ChatBots

For this meet up you will be tasked to create a basic chat bot that can handle basic conversation between a human and computer.  To use this we will be making use of the [CatterBot library](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot). 

The  ChatterBot library is an easy to use Python library that already has most of the logic for a conversational engine built in.  For this exercise you will have to install the ChatterBot library and run the included python files.  This will start a new ChatterBot instance that will learn as you talk to it.  The ChatterBot github page also has more examples that you can work though and play around with.

Next try to use one of the following API's  see if you can create a different bot that will give it advance conversational capabilities, such as fetching the latest weather report or creating notes and tasks etc.  If you are really feeling ambitious you can create a chat bot that will mimic you and respond to conversations on facebook or twitter.

### Other API's

* [WIT.AI](https://wit.ai/) - WIT.AI has an easy to use Bot Engine and Intent Parses.
* [APP.AI](https://api.ai/) - With API.AI, you can create conversational scenarios within minutes, then build advanced dialogues to manage the conversation flow with the user.
* [Chatfuel](https://chatfuel.com/) - Chatfuel is a service that allows to quickly and easily create a Facebook chat bot.
* [Converse AI](http://www.converse.ai/) - Converse AI has a chat flow system with integrations into many other services allowing you to easily build chat bots for those channels.
